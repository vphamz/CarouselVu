Homework 2

10 or more hours to complete homework - still having bugs

Finished most of the required tasks.  Had issues around: 
1) Dismissing the keyboard in the sign in screen (and having subviews return to original placement
2) Did not get around to adding logic for incorrect login
3) Did not get the page control to disappear
